# [Cookstagram](https://cookstagram.onrender.com/)

Cookstagram is a simple yet effective MERN stack web application usable in modern browsers and was created using MongoDB, Mongoose, Express.js, Node.js, React, and AWS for functionality and Semantic UI for core element styling.

## Concept

Cookstagram provides a social media experience centered around culinary exploration.  Upon logging in, users may create posts of the favorite recipes with data types including:

- Title
- Image
- Ingredients
- Instructions

Using this information, users create posts which are populated in the main feed of the application as well as each users profile page.

Users are able to remove delete posts using delete functionality from their logged in profile page.

>__Note__: Users must be logged in to use all features of the application.

## Instructions

The user signs up selecting a username, an email, a password, and completing a short bio as well as including a profile picture:

Upon creating an account, the user is logged in and may __create__ recipes to share with the world by filling out the RecipeAddForm.  With each ingridient and instruction, the user can press enter to begin a new line within the form field:

After clicking "Add Dish" at the bottom of the form, the users recipe is added to the feed along with all other recipes from all other users.  Be default, the actual recipe portion is hidden to conserve space.  Users may click the "Show More" tag to view the recipe in it's entirety
